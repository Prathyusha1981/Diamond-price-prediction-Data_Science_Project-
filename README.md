# Diamond-price-prediction-Data_Science_Project-
Data Science Objective- I need to build a model which predicts, 
with a high-level accuracy, the market price in US dollars of a diamond 
by relating the prices of De Beers diamonds which were sold to their 
features. Since, I want my model to be as accurate as possible, I will 
optimize the mean absolute error on the testing set (which is a metric 
for accuracy) instead of the R² (i.e., the coefficient of determination) 
regression score on the testing set (which is a metric of precision).


Problem statement:
Diamond price prediction based on their cut, colour, clarity, 
price..etc attributes

Outcome:
The market price in US dollars of a diamond by relating the prices of 
De Beers diamonds which were sold to their features

I have considered the classic Diamonds dataset which contains the 
prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds and this dataset 
is hosted on Kaggle. The dataset contains 53940 rows and 10 variables. 
Before jumping into building the model, let’s have a look into the 
variables & their definitions.
1. Price is in US dollars  
2.Carat weight of the diamond  
3 Cut quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)  
4.color diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best) 
5. clarity a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), 
SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best)) 
6.x length in mm 
7. y width in mm 
8. z depth in mm   
9. depth: The height of a diamond  
10. table: The width of the diamond’s table expressed as a percentage
of its average diameter
